# Azure Functions for Splunk

This repository contains available [Azure Functions]( https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) to integrate Microsoft data with Splunk.  Azure Functions can be triggered by certain events like an event arriving on an Event Hub, a blob written to a storage account, a Microsoft Teams call concluding, etc.  The functions in this repository respond to these events and route data to Splunk accordingly.

## Getting Started

Each available set of functions in this repository is contained within its own folder.  For example, the Microsoft Graph functions are contained in the graph folder.  To deploy the functions to your Azure environment, click the Deploy to Azure button located in the README.md in the corresponding function folder.

## Available Functions

| Functions | Location | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft Teams | [graph](https://github.com/splunk/azure-functions-splunk/tree/master/graph) | Collects [Microsoft Teams call records]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/callrecords-callrecord).  This data can be used with the [Microsoft 365 App for Splunk]( https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3786/) and/or the [RWI â€“ Executive Dashboard]( https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4952/) |
| Azure Event Hubs | [event-hubs-hec](https://github.com/splunk/azure-functions-splunk/tree/master/event-hubs-hec) | These Azure Functions are triggered by events arriving on an Azure Event Hub.  The functions then process the events and send the event to a listening Splunk HTTP Event Collector |
| Azure Storage | [storage-hec](https://github.com/splunk/azure-functions-splunk/tree/master/storage-hec) | These Azure Functions are triggered by writes to an Azure Storage account.  The functions process the data to send to a listening Splunk HTTP Event Collector |

## Setting a Project Subpath
[Multiple Azure Function projects](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azurefunctions/wiki/Multiple-function-projects) exist in this repository.  In order to debug a specific function project, set the `azureFunctions.deploySubpath` and `azureFunctions.projectSubpath` parameters in `settings.json` to the appropriate path.

For example, to run and debug the `Graph` functions use the following `settings.json`
```
{
    "azureFunctions.postDeployTask": "npm install",
    "azureFunctions.projectLanguage": "JavaScript",
    "azureFunctions.projectRuntime": "~3",
    "debug.internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen",
    "azureFunctions.preDeployTask": "npm prune",
    "azureFunctions.deploySubpath": "graph",
    "azureFunctions.projectSubpath": "graph"
}
```
